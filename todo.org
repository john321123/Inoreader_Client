** TODO update Â© notices
** TODO see if ucs-insert can handle some html entities
   For example (ucs-insert 8216) see the ucs-insert docs for how to
   handle hex and octal
** WONTFIX Add a "fetch more" line at the end of the buffer
   Not sure about this one as marking read and refreshing might be sufficient
   only when the fetch window is less than the total number
** DONE load all rows in batches
*** DONE Implement incremental fetches with continuation tokens
** TODO Make the sort area of the header clickable
** TODO add 'o' keybinding to change order as well
