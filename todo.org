** TODO update Â© notices
** TODO see if ucs-insert can handle some html entities
   For example (ucs-insert 8216) see the ucs-insert docs for how to
   handle hex and octal
** TODO Add a "fetch more" line at the end of the buffer
   to fetch beyond the grc-max-fetch-count
** DONE load all rows in batches
*** DONE Implement incremental fetches with continuation tokens
** TODO Make the sort area of the header clickable
*** TODO add 'o' keybinding to change order as well
** DONE grc won't reload the list if the list buffer exists even when it should
   Specifically, when doing C-u grc to switch to a different list type
** DONE I was mistaken
   fetching read/starred/kept comes back with oldest first
   should probably be reversed
** DONE the read view somehow is saying that I have 10 unread
   probably the case that the unread count is using the unread tag, no matter what
** DONE find a better way to extract the href
